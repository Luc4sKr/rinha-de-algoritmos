   s√£o referentes aos exemplos dados, √© somente uma concatena√ß√£o para se referir
      aos arquivos localizados na pasta ./resources/input,
     ```clojure 
     (defn input
        [example]
        (with-open [rdr (reader (str "./resources/input/" example ".txt"))]
        (doall (mapv vector (line-seq rdr)))))```
   
  se for necess√°rio testar outras entradas, √© s√≥ adicionar o arquivo nessa pasta.

To run the program, follow these steps:

Using docker...
* In that same directory, run the command: `docker build problema1 .`
* Then run the command `docker run --rm -it problema1`
    * As input there are 3 options:
        - example1
        - example2
        - example3

  refer to the examples given, it is just a concatenation to refer
  to files located in the ./resources/input folder,
    ```clojure 
    (defn input
       [example]
       (with-open [rdr (reader (str "./resources/input/" example ".txt"))]
       (doall (mapv vector (line-seq rdr)))))```

If you need to test other entries, just add the file to this folder.
